<h2>More about Me</h2>
<h3>My Childhood
I grew up in northern New Jersey. My father walked to the corner to take the bus into Manhattan to work, a 25-minute ride. He was a mathematician-turned-computer-scientist when he began working for IBM in the 1950s. As a child in the early 1960s, on days off from school, I got to go to work with my Dad and "play" on prototypes of what would become ATMs in the 1980s. Later, I took a first programming course in 1973, "Algebra II with Computers," punchcards and all! I went on to become a musician and music teacher, but technology is dear to my heart. It is breathtaking to look at what has been accomplished in the ensuing decades.
